# Personal website

Hi, I'm Nasko and this is my personal website's repo. I am serving this through Jekyll and using GH pages for web hosting. Cloudflare provides some much needed protection service. Given the static nature of the content here, I would likely not be switching to a complex UI any time soon (though I am impressed with the capabilities of modern front-end frameworks!)
