I trained instances 
of ResNet 50 and Inception V3 which allows us to compare &lt;i&gt; SafeTree &lt;/i&gt; with state-of-
the-art models. These new models, however, require fine-tuning in order to achieve better results.
The preliminary results point at approximately 67% validation accuracy. It is important to point
out the “Pr_Po_Im” scenario was used for training which typically leads to worse results given
the three-class problem. Additionally, I generated performance summary metrics and classification reports for the different archutectures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After training ResNet 50 and Inception V3 on multiple resolution types and scenarios, I discovered
that deep networks tend to require much longer training (more than 100 epochs) for convergence to
occur. Moreover, a three-class problem such as the Probable/Possible/Improbable classification still
represents a challenge even for a state-of the-art model. Partially, this could be attributed to the size of the input data set
as both Resnet and Inception typically require thousands of images for sufficient training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By visualizing the CNN performance I observed that training reaches its limit between the 60th and 100th epoch. Early Stopping is a way to arrive at the optimal epoch values earlier and also avoid overtraining the networks.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">One of the main objectives of the AI Trees project is to attain the optimal CNN performance.

This is the research question which has guided the &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/narslab/inference-tree-risk&quot;&gt;AI for Tree Risk Prediction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; project.
The motivation behind this work lies in the importance of vegatation and trees in particular in infrastructure management. Large portion of power outages are caused by trees which results in high direct cost to utility companies. A study by Graziano et al. &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; estimated that $8.3 billion in revenue was lost in CT alone between 2005 and 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, likelihood of tree failure assessments have been conducted through drive-by windshield surveys and walk-by surveys. In our study we examine the potential for AI to process and predict tree failure near roadside electrical distribution lines. We are designing a framework which automates tree risk classification using a convolutional neural network. Ultimately, our model strives to promote efficiency, reduce costs and increase reliability in modern infrastructure management.&lt;/p&gt;
